# Documentation Guidelines

Documentation should be clear and accessible to a broad audience, including those without deep technical expertise.

## General Guidelines

- Use Markdown format for all documentation files.
- Maintain a consistent structure across documents.
- Write in clear, concise language.
- Organize content into sections with appropriate headings.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity.
