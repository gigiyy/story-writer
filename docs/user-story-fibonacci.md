# User Story: User-Friendly Fibonacci Calculator

As a web user, I want an intuitive and responsive interface to calculate Fibonacci numbers so that I can quickly obtain results with clear feedback and minimal friction.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Scenario: Real-time input validation
  Given I am on the Fibonacci calculator page
  When I type a negative number or non-integer
  Then I see an immediate visual feedback indicating invalid input
  And the submit button is disabled
  And a helpful error message explains the valid input range

Scenario: Smooth calculation experience
  Given I have entered a valid number n
  When I click the calculate button
  Then I see a loading indicator while calculating
  And the result appears with a subtle animation
  And the result includes both n and its Fibonacci value
  And the input field remains focused for easy recalculation

Scenario: Responsive mobile interface
  Given I am using a mobile device
  When I view the Fibonacci calculator
  Then I see a touch-friendly number input
  And the calculator fits well on my screen
  And the virtual keyboard shows the number pad

Scenario: Keyboard navigation support
  Given I am using a keyboard
  When I press Tab and Enter keys
  Then I can navigate all controls
  And trigger calculation with the Enter key
  And see visual focus indicators
```

## Notes
- Input validation should be immediate (client-side) with clear visual cues
- Use progressive enhancement: work without JS but enhance with JS
- Support screen readers with ARIA labels and live regions
- Consider adding input history or quick preset values
- Provide visual feedback during calculation for large values
- Support dark/light theme based on system preference
