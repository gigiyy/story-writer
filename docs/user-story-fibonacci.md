# User Story: User-Friendly Fibonacci Calculator

As a web user, I want to calculate Fibonacci numbers through an accessible and efficient interface so that I can explore mathematical sequences with confidence and ease.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Scenario: Smart input validation
  Given I am on the Fibonacci calculator page
  When I enter any input value
  Then I see real-time validation feedback
  And invalid inputs are clearly marked with both color and text
  And the maximum input size is enforced to prevent performance issues

Scenario: Efficient calculation handling
  Given I have entered a valid number n between 0 and 100
  When I submit the calculation request
  Then the result displays within 1 seconds

Scenario: Cross-device accessibility
  Given I access the calculator from any device
  When I interact with the interface
  Then I can use touch, mouse, or keyboard controls
  And the layout adapts to my screen size
  And all interactive elements have sufficient touch targets
  And the calculator remains usable at any zoom level

Scenario: Enhanced user experience
  Given I am using the calculator
  When I perform multiple calculations
  Then I see my recent calculation history
  And I can quickly reuse previous inputs
  And the interface provides helpful tooltips
  And I receive clear feedback for all actions
```

## Notes
- Implement client-side validation with server-side verification
- Optimize calculation algorithm for numbers up to n=100
- Cache common Fibonacci values to improve response time
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for accessibility
- Support both light and dark themes with sufficient contrast
- Include error boundary for graceful failure handling
- Provide clear performance expectations for large numbers
